Vacuum gathers, and now my watch begins.
It shall not end until my death. 
//I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. 
I shall wear no crown and win no glory.
I shall live and die at my post. 
I am the sword in the darkness. 
I am the watcher in the outerspace. 
I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realm of men. 
I pledge my life and honor to the Vacuum's Watch, for this space and all the spaces to come.

THE BATTLE IN THE TUNNEL!
